Dreams
======

* Python 3 as the default
* Unified, built-in, and first-class support for multiple python versions, virtual environments, and package management when developing
* Improved interfaces, improved mixins, and no more inheritance
* Optional explicit typing
* Actually adopting aspects of functional programming, no longer treating them as dirty step-children in the language
* Bundled deliverables for deployments, with only one final binary file to drop on-disk
* No more GIL, combined with a mature asyncio, leading to only one necessary process to run
