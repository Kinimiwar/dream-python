# Dreams

* Simplify packaging dramatically for the 80% of the projects (setuptools is so
  complex even experienced Pythonista's need to consult the docs every time, or
  copy-paste)
* PyPy3 as the default Python everywhere (not just PyPy)
* Constructivism, not criticism, in the Python 2/3 debate
* A Python 2.8 with the sole goal of bridging the transition to 3.x smoothly
  and pragmatically
* Significant efforts to improve performance of Python runtimes (continuing
  development of projects like PyPy, and [Pyston][1])
* Support for [algebraic data types][2]
* Optional (lightweight) type annotations, for clarity of code and to assist
  the interpreter
