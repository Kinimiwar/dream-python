## Community

- More Loving & Accepting (we're already quite good at this). 
- *One obvious way to do it*, in more areas (e.g. installation). 

## Technical

- More Linux-Philosophy Friendly (e.g. [taco-bell programming](http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html))
- PyPy as the default Python everywhere â€” one day.
- No more Python 2 / 3 decisions.
