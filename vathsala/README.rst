Dreams
======

- I hope there can be more tolerance towards newcomers
- I wish there was a place just for beginners so that they can get comfortable and grow 
- A community where gender doesn't matter and I won't be treated differently because I'm a woman.
- Less hate or irritation or whateveryoucallit towards Python 2 users!
- Platform dependent help because I struggle to find help for windows related bugs
