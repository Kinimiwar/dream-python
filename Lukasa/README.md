# Dreams

- Greater diversity across the Python community as a whole.
- More tolerance for new programmers.
- More tolerance in general.
- Less brutal python-* mailing lists: LKML should not be an example.
- Python 2 put out to pasture.
- More efficient process for getting patches reviewed in CPython.
