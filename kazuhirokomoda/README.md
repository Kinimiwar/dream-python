# My dreams

I love Python especially when I process data and implement algorithms quickly.
Here are my dreams…

- Easier handling of Japanese strings (In “Natural Language Processing with Python”, a dedicated chapter is written only for dealing with Japanese: http://www.nltk.org/book-jp/ch12.html)

- Python conference(s) to be held at more affordable prices
