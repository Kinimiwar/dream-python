#Dreams

* Kill the NIH and language affinity and focus on integrating python into widely used, interchangable tech
 - Mercurial vs. git
 - ReStructuredText vs. Markdown
* Better PyPy/Python3 support and use
* PyPy Rust-lang interop w/o using C as a bridge
* Make Asyncio more usable. It's callback hell unless you use quasar or other library to front it
* Increase wheel usage in pip packages
* Improve pip/virtualenv toolchain
 - Behind proxy sometimes an issue
 - pip output and documentation can be clunky for edge cases and hard to read at times
 - possibly look into colored interactive-focused output (a la apt)
* Improve virtualenv wrapper especially for non-bash shells
* Better plan for websocket and server-sent events within or about WSGI
* Create a better way to work with RDBMS and NoSQL datastores that isn't an ORM and loosely couples data migration
* See more wrappers, generators and with statements used
* A return of py2exe (with windows and osx support) for sharing our one-off programs with non-programmers
* Continue to be a first language for learners and a home for hackers and tinkerers
