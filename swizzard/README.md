# Python Dreams
## Portability
  + Streamlined distribution pipeline
  + Either something in the standard library, or some a PEP to standardize things

## All PyPy Everything
  + PyPy + (the best parts of) Py3K as default interpreter
  
## More FP support
  + API to decouple objects from methods/make objects implicit
  + Chainable objects/some equivalent of Clojure's [threading macros](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/-%3E)
