First of all: Python is awesome!

- More Linux-Philosophy Friendly (from @kennethreitz)
- Python 3 everywhere
- Better packaging system
- Easy use of multiple cores
- Autocompletion in default shell
- PyPy as the default Python everywhere (from @alex).

And for all people out there making decisions about technologies to be used:
Python can definitely be used in bigger projects! There are more than
enough evidences!
