# Ian's Dreams

- More diversity of core Python contributors and OSS Python contributors

- A more diverse board of directors for the PSF

- A less acrimonious python-dev mailing list

- Python 3 faster than Python 2

- No more Python 2 vs Python 3 debates

- A better base http library

- More local user groups that support and mentor new Pythonistas

- More people willing to call out problematic and sexist behaviour when they see it

- A safer community for everyone who wants to use Python and contribute

- Fewer "thought leaders" who spread lies and FUD about aspects of security, diversity, and the future of the language
